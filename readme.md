# Spelling

A test project to see if I can create a spelling app for my son 
that allows him to drag and drop letters into the correct
order to spell words.

Requirements

* Drag and drop
* Word split into letters that are all draggable
* Validate correct position on drop
* If correct position ignore drag start for letter
* Play sound of letter on dragging
* Once all letters are correct the level is over
